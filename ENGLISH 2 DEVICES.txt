We go to talking about the difference between a Computer and a Mobile Phone
The main difference is the size, -being- the mobile phone more bit because was though for the gentleman need move alltime
like Teachers, Cops, Doctors, and anybody worker.
While the computers is most used for case like helpers of call-lines, secretaries, and banks. Jobs where you don't need move anywhere.
The -disadvantage- from computers is most cost because they be most high-speed and need more energy, and the Mobile Phone is most sofisty, but
need be charge more often.

You could do with the computer is play videogames, edit videos and images most profesionally, programming, and somecases take pictures at laptops with chamera.

At Mobile Phone is most to do calls, send messagges, play videogames, take pictures or videos and edit videos and images.

Yeah, very similarity, but the Computer can do -close one- all like a Mobile Phone most profesionally.
